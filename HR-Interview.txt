5. how do you handle conflict within team.

--I handle conflict by focusing on open communication and collaboration. I start by actively listening to all perspectives to understand
 the root of the issue. I then work to identify common goals and find a solution that addresses everyone’s concerns. In my experience,
 maintaining a calm and professional demeanor, and being open to compromise, helps to resolve conflicts effectively and maintain
 positive working relationships

our point infromt he team and then team came up with a solution which 


5 .What is your salary expectations?

I am expecting 180k as targeted salary all including and yes its always negotiable.

5.What are your weakness?
“My greatest weakness is that I sometimes focus too much on the details of a project and spend too much time analyzing the finer points. 
I’ve been striving to improve in this area by checking in with myself at regular intervals and giving myself a chance to re-focusing on the 
bigger picture. That way I can still ensure quality without getting so caught up in the details that it affects my productivity or the team’s 
ability to meet the deadline.”


6 .Team conflict?
In one of the project, some of tasks had a depedency on my teammates tasks, which he was constanlty submitting late  costing my productivuty.
 So, I called him for a coffee, I asked him about it  and asked is he going through any personal problems or it was work load. he said  
 he is  been working  two projects parallely, and I requested him to make dependency tasks as priority than other tasks and told him that 
 If he needs any help I would be happpy to help him and hea was hapy that I talked to him and resolved it perosnally.
 


7.	What's your strongest example of communication ability? What did you communicate?

I communicated with my clients when I worked with IBM to find out the requirements of the project.we used to have weekly meetings and mothnly releases
When we work with a client you know that there will be many situations in which we have to communicate with them. One of those situations is our 
Project Demo. I was the one who gave the presentation and interacted with them for further improvements and all. We used to provide some of the 
solutions to client by developing prototypes.I remebered one demo, where we used ml for one of the repository appliation similar to google
instead searching by typing the things , we used ml, directly scanning the device code to get the documents related to the particular device

8.Tell me about a time you made a mistake and what was the outcome?
 This incident was during my training days at IBM  where i waas given assesment to collect syslogs, weblogs 
 from servers and build a dashboard. At the endo of assessmnet, I figure out that network team and  I were on differentt page about end results.
 Those were minor changes was able to correct them. That mistake had helped me understand how things can get worse with differnet perspectives and 
 from then I  make sure that beofre starting a prohect/task, end user and I are  on the same page.

10. what are the challeges you faced and how did yout ackled those 

11. which things you want to learn in the next job and what are those why 
12. what made you to show isnterest in this company 

--tell about a challengin situation you faced and how did you overcome?
--S-when we are in midst of infra migration, moving our production environment from on prem to aws. migration involved mutliple services like
 microservices, dbs, cicd pipelines . one of the biggest challenge was ensuring zero downtime of our critical applications. 
A-my respositiblity was to design and develop migration startegy  and also work with different teams to address any issues that arose during the 
process. this inovloved in detailed planning, setting up infra in aws and fallback plan if something goes wrong
T- I started by conduction thorugh analysys of our current evn, identifying dependecies and documneting entire architecure. I worked with 
applciation and db teams to create phased migration migration, which allowed us to move services gradually, starting with less critical components.
We used tools like Terraform for infrastructure as code to replicate our environment in AWS, and Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
To minimize downtime, we implemented a blue-green deployment strategy, where we set up identical environments in AWS and switched 
traffic from the old environment to the new one in a controlled manner. We also set up detailed monitoring and logging using AWS 
CloudWatch and ELK stack to catch any issues early.
During the actual migration, we encountered some unexpected performance bottlenecks due to differences in the networking setup 
between our on-premises data center and AWS. To address this, I worked with the networking team to reconfigure our VPC and 
optimized our load balancers and auto-scaling groups to handle the increased traffic."
R- The migration was completed successfully with no downtime and minimal disruption to our users. Post-migration, we saw a significant
 improvement in application performance and scalability. Additionally, our infrastructure costs were reduced by 20%.
