-- Horizontal Vs Vertical Scalling

HS-Scaling horizontally simply means adding more computers rather than upgrading the hardware of a single one.
VS-  way to handle more traffic would be to upgrade the hardware the database is running on. This is called scaling vertically.

--Distributed System
-- distributed system in its most simplest definition is a group of computers working together as to appear as a single computer to the end-user. These machines have a shared state, 
operate concurrently and can fail independently without affecting the whole systemâ€™s uptime.

DISASTER Recovery in Cloud 

--Data Replication: Safeguarding Your Critical Information
AWS offers a variety of data replication services, such as AWS Storage Gateway, Amazon S3, and AWS DataSync, to ensure that your data is consistently replicated to a secondary location. 
--Compute Resources: Powering Your Recovery Efforts
In the event of a disaster, AWS provides a wide range of compute resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, to quickly provision and deploy your applications and services in the secondary location. 
--Traffic Routing: Seamlessly Transitioning to Recovery
Amazon Route 53, AWS's scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service, plays a pivotal role in routing traffic to your secondary location during a disaster. 
--Automated Scaling: Adapting to Fluctuating Demands
AWS Auto Scaling allows your applications to automatically adjust their capacity based on demand. It can ensure that your secondary environment can handle increased workloads without compromising performance.
--Load Balancing: Distributing Traffic for Optimal Performance
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) helps distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. 
--Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO): Tailoring Your Recovery Plan
AWS provides tools to set RTO and RPO targets for your applications. These targets define the acceptable downtime and data loss in a disaster scenario. 

âœ…AWS Disaster Recovery Architecture Network Components
The AWS Disaster Recovery architecture is built on a foundation of secure and reliable network components:

ðŸ’¥Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):provides isolated network environments

ðŸ’¥Amazon Route 53:directs traffic to the appropriate location

ðŸ’¥AWS Direct Connect or VPN: 
provide secure connectivity between your primary and secondary environments.

ðŸ’¥AWS Backup and Storage Gateway:provide data storage and replication capabilities.

ðŸ’¥Load Balancers: distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets for optimal performance.

ðŸ’¥AWS Backup and Storage Gateway: manage data backup, recovery, and replication.

ðŸ’¥Compute Resources: host applications and services in your secondary location.

ðŸ’¥Security Groups and Network ACLs: control lists control traffic to and from your resources, ensuring security.
