about me:

I am a Senior DevOps Engineer with extensive experience in cloud architecture, specializing in designing and deploying AWS,Azure 
infrastructure using Terraform. My expertise includes cloud networking, security, and automating infrastructure provisioning. 
I have a strong background in containerization with Docker and orchestrating Kubernetes clusters. Additionally, I am skilled in CI/CD 
tools like GitLab and Jenkins, configuration management with Ansible, and implementing monitoring solutions with Datadog, Prometheus, 
Grafana, and alerting systems like Opsgenie to ensure reliable and secure system operations. 
I code in python and shell to automatate repetative tasks and have hands-on experience with SAST, SCA, and DAST tools including SonarQube, 
Veracode, Synopsys, and Tenable.

CURRENT ROLE RESPONSIBILITES:
In my current role as a Senior DevOps Engineer, my day-to-day responsibilities are divided into two main areas: development and support.

Development:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): I focus on developing and managing infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring that our AWS environments are 
scalable, secure, and aligned with the needs of various teams, such as data engineers and application developers. This includes writing 
and maintaining Terraform modules, automating resource provisioning, and implementing best practices for cloud infrastructure.

CI/CD Pipeline Management: I design and maintain CI/CD pipelines using GitLab, integrating them with Jenkins, Ansible, and Docker. 
This involves automating the build, test, and deployment processes, as well as integrating security tools like SonarQube, Veracode, and S
ynopsys to ensure code quality and compliance. we already have some CI?CD pipeliines for applciation , if we get any request to develop
new CI?CD pipepline for new appilcations , then we work onit. along with this we also try to optimize existing pipelines like 
reducing deployment time or increasing security.

Containerization and Orchestration: I work on containerizing applications using Docker, transforming monolithic Java applications into
 microservices, and deploying them on Kubernetes (EKS). This includes managing Kubernetes clusters, optimizing deployments, and ensuring
 that our microservices architecture is robust and scalable.

Support:
AWS Infrastructure Support: I handle day-to-day support for AWS infrastructure, addressing any issues or requests that arise. This 
involves monitoring cloud resources, troubleshooting problems, and responding to alerts. We use Jira to track these tasks, where 
tickets are created for AWS-related issues such as performance bottlenecks, security incidents, or resource scaling.

Incident Management: I am responsible for managing incidents related to our infrastructure and applications. This includes identifying 
the root cause of issues, implementing fixes, and ensuring that similar issues are prevented in the future. I collaborate closely with
 other teams to resolve incidents quickly and efficiently.

Collaboration and Documentation: I regularly collaborate with developers, data engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure that 
infrastructure changes align with project requirements. I document processes, configurations, and best practices in Confluence, 
ensuring that our knowledge base is up to date and accessible.

Tools and Tracking:
Jira: We use Jira extensively to manage our work, track progress, and ensure that all tasks are completed on time. Jira boards help 
us visualize the workflow, prioritize tasks, and manage both development and support activities. I also use Jira to log and 
track issues, ensuring that all AWS-related problems are documented and resolved promptly.
Daily Standups and Meetings: I participate in daily standups and regular meetings with cross-functional teams to discuss ongoing 
projects, address any blockers, and plan upcoming work. These meetings are crucial for keeping everyone aligned and 
ensuring that our development and support efforts are coordinated.
