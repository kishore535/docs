BLUEGREEN - CANARY 

Blue-Green Deployment and Canary Deployment are both strategies used to deploy new versions of applications with minimal risk and 
downtime. Here’s a detailed explanation of each:

Blue-Green Deployment
Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy where two identical environments, known as the "blue" and "green" environments, are used
 to ensure smooth releases and quick rollbacks.

How It Works:

Setup: You have two environments that are exact replicas of each other. Let's call them "blue" and "green". Only one environment is 
live and serving production traffic at any time. The other environment is idle or used for testing.
Deployment: When a new version of the application is ready, it is deployed to the inactive environment (e.g., "green"). The "blue" 
environment continues to serve all user traffic during this time.
Testing: You perform comprehensive testing on the "green" environment. This includes functional testing, performance testing, and 
validation to ensure that the new version works as expected.
Switch Traffic: Once you’re confident that the "green" environment is stable, you switch the traffic from the "blue" environment to
 the "green" environment. This switch is usually handled by updating the load balancer configuration or DNS records.
Rollback: If any issues are discovered after the switch, you can quickly roll back to the "blue" environment by redirecting traffic
 back. This provides a quick and safe way to revert to the previous version.

Advantages:
Minimized Downtime: Switching traffic between environments is instantaneous.
Easy Rollback: You can quickly revert to the old version if any issues arise.
Testing in Production: You can test the new version in a production-like environment.
Disadvantages:
Resource Intensive: Maintaining two environments can be costly and resource-intensive.
Complexity: Managing two environments and ensuring they are in sync can be complex.


Canary Deployment
Canary Deployment is a gradual release strategy where a new version of an application is rolled out to a small subset of users before a
 full-scale deployment.

How It Works:

Initial Deployment: You deploy the new version (canary) to a small percentage of users or servers while the old version continues to 
serve the rest of the traffic.
Monitoring: You closely monitor the performance, stability, and user feedback of the canary release. This includes tracking metrics 
like error rates, response times, and user experience.
Gradual Rollout: If the canary deployment is successful and no significant issues are detected, you gradually increase the percentage 
of traffic routed to the new version. This can be done in phases (e.g., 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%).
Full Deployment: Once the new version has been validated across all canary phases, you fully deploy it to all users. If issues are 
detected during the canary phases, you can halt the rollout and roll back to the previous version.
Rollback: If a critical issue is detected during the canary phase, you can stop the deployment and revert to the previous version without affecting the majority of users.

Advantages:
Reduced Risk: Problems are detected early with a smaller group of users, minimizing the impact.
Gradual Rollout: Allows for a phased rollout and user feedback collection.
Real User Testing: Provides insights from real users rather than just staging tests.
Disadvantages:
Complexity: Requires sophisticated traffic management and monitoring tools.
Delayed Full Release: Full rollout may take longer, which can delay the availability of new features to all users.
